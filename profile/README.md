# Political Transparency

## Introduction
Political Transparency is a web application aimed at providing the Israeli public with insights into the daily operations of the Israeli parliament, known as the Knesset Israel.<br>
Our platform enables users to easily search for bills and votes, express their own opinions through voting, and receive a compiled roster of parliament members who have participated <br> in at least one of their selected votes. This list will be organized to showcase members whose voting aligns most closely with the user's opinions, offering valuable insights that can potentially influence upcoming governmental decisions.
